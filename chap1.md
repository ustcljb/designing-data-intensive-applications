# Reliable, scalable and maintainable applications

-  Many data-intensive applications include the following functionalities:
    -  Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (*databases*)
    -  Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (*caches*)
    -  Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (*search indexes*)
    -  Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (*stream processing*)
    -  Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (*batch processing*)
